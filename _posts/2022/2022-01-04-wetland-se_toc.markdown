## Introduction

Sweden has large areas of both intact and drained wetlands. In this project you will access different spatial datasets and combine them for creating wetland maps that relate to the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) balance of Swedish wetlands. This post summarizes the processing as a Table of Contents linking to the relevant posts with the processing steps.

## [Datasets](../wetland-se_datasets)

For the project of mapping Swedish wetlands and their climate impact, the following data sets are required:

- Landcover
- Soil moisture
- Wetlands
- Topography
- Ditches
- Geology (incl. organic soils)

These are described in the post [Datasets](../wetland-se_datasets)

## [Geographical region](../wetland-se_defregion)

Before you can start working with the geographic data you must [create a Framework projection system for SWEREF99](../wetland-se_defregion), the Swedish national projection system.
